* The detector consists of an raspberry hq camera, connected to a raspberry, that is mounted on top of a black box with an M6 screw and a nut.
* The black box is put over the light source, an blueBoxâ„¢ S Transilluminator [^1].
* The image is then taken with a shell script that uses raspistill.
* The image can be analysed via ImageJ or, for instance, an python opencv solution.
